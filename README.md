# Twitter-Disaster-Predictor

In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning-based classification model that can automatically identify whether a tweet is related to a disaster or not. The model will utilize the power of deep learning algorithms to learn the underlying patterns and features from the tweet text. We will use a labeled dataset of disaster and non-disaster tweets for training and testing the model's performance.
